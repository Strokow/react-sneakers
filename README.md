# react-sneakers
My first independent project, which I started after I finally decided to focus on Frontend development. 

## Languages and frameworks
- JavaScript
- SCSS
- HTML
- React
- React Hooks
- React Skeleton
- React Route
- Node.js
- Git

## Additional tools
- Adobe Illustrator (main logo)

## Difficulties
• Setting up the correct display of elements from MokAPI
• Resolving the conflict between the child and parent product ID

Please do not judge this project strictly :)
